Wife would pay all expenses relating to the marital home, excluding the HELOC, but including the mortgage, utilities and taxes. Wife shall use the support award and her portion of the asset distribution to support her remining time in the marital home. At the end of 18 months, the Parties shall place the marital home on the market and distribute the net profits equally. \n\nB.\tCommercial Properties \nThe Parties own together, 13 Saybrooke St., Brighton (valued at $1,000,000) and 17 Marsh St., Quincy (valued at $660,000). Husband shall buy wife out of the commercial properties for a total of $515,332 , which represents Wife’s half of 13 Saybroke ($339,000) and 17 Marsh street ($176,332) within 90 days of the Agreement adjudication. \n\nC.\tHusband’s 401K \nThe Parties shall divide Husband’s 401K equally (50/50) via QDRO. \n\nD.\tStocks/Investment Accounts\nHusband maintain that there are several accounts that he procured prior to marriage. Wife asserts that assets have been significantly commingled, accessed, and/or appreciated during the marriage, and she is therefore, entitled to a percentage. \n\nAs such, Wife proposes that the following accounts shall be divided 30/70 (wife/Husband):\n•\tJNL PS GR ($259,775)\n•\tSEI Private Client ($6,757), \n•\tPacific Oak REIT ($23,996), \n•\tE. Schwab TOPS Roth IRA ($187,506), and Schwab Rollover IRA ($132,307). \n\nII.\tDebts\n1.\tCollege Loans: the Parties agreed to send their oldest child, Tristan, during the marriage to his present college. Husband agreed to procure loans and/or pay for his tuition prior to the marriage. Wife maintains that he should not be responsible for the loans up to the present date. Going forward, Parties agree to pay for college up to 1/3 of UMass Amherst for each child, if they are able. Parties shall both cooperate in assisting children with obtaining FAFSA loans, and/or student loans, as necessary.\n\n\n2.\t“Debts” to Marjorie Linn: Wife’s position remains unchanged. Husband now claims to have take several “loans” from his mother Marjorie Linn, however, Wife believes this is a “pre-inheritance” rather than a loan Husband will be required to pay back. Further, all such loans were taken without any input and/or knowledge from her. As such, Wife does not believe she should be liable for a percentage of these loans. \n\nIII.\tSUPPORT\n\nA.\tSupport/Alimony: The Support award was agreed upon prior to wife learning about the health insurance and other expenses husband expects wife to pay as part of the agreement. The award would not be sustainable. In reviewing the support/alimony award, her need is $6000/mo husband currently paying DOR $600 per week paid biweekly and all normal and customary Braintree costs to include mortgage etc. currently at $6500 a month. \n\nB.\tExtracurriculars: Husband put in agreement children auto insurance is $3115 – these expenses along with health insurance and Tristan’s apartment would make it impossible for Wife to make ends meet. Wife will only share in costs if assets split fairly and equitably.\n\nC.\tHealth Insurance: Wife will be able to remain on insurance plan provided by husband until …..\n\n"

You will each pay 1/3 of his apartment and costs associated with same. \nPast Loans: 50/50 division for past student debts. You can look into your share of the loan and roll into a Parent Plus loan, if able.  Or, you each pay ½ of interest until loan balance comes due.  I would recommend paying your share off with sale of the home if the debt is not able to be transferred to a low interest bearing account,  in light of the high interest rate on this loan. \n\n    Support:\n\n$694 child support + 85 alimony, to be modified when tristan emancipates. This number is derived from splitting the        difference between their calculation (using a 50/50, and 2 over 18, with assigning you an income of $37,000 annually, and only one commercial property income as he is living in the other, and inclusive of his bonus) and ours, (no income attribution, and 2 children over 18 living with mother 67% or more of the time, including his bonus, and both properties being attributed as income).\n\n    Health insurance: \n\nThis will continue to be paid by Jeff. \n\nAssets:\n100K to be paid up front which will be a combination of an advance on Marsh Street and your % of the premarital stocks. He needs five years to buy you out of the rest.  This allows you to have, between the 100K up front and the sale of the home, around 263K to pay debts and find suitable housing following the sale of the home. \n\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nBetsy\n\n"
